# Introduction

`gql.tada` aims to tie GraphQL and TypeScript closer together and minimize friction,
by improving the experience of writing and using GraphQL with more editor feedback,
automatically derived types, and additional built-in tools that don't get in your
way.

Once `gql.tada` is set up, we write our GraphQL queries in pure TypeScript,
queries automatically infer their types, and editors provide immediate feedback,
auto-completion, diagnostics, and GraphQL type hints.<br />
All on-the-fly in TypeScript with as few setup steps as possible.
