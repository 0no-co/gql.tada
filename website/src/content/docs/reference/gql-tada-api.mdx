## Functions

### `graphql()`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `input` argument | A string of a GraphQL document. |
| `fragments` argument | An optional list of other GraphQL fragments created with this function. |
| returns | A GraphQL `DocumentNode` with result and variables types. | 

Creates a `DocumentNode` with result and variables types.

You can compose fragments into this function by passing them and a fragment
mask will be created for them.
When creating queries, the returned document of queries can be passed into GraphQL clients
which will then automatically infer the result and variables types.

It is used with your schema in `setupSchema` to create a result type
of your queries, fragments, and variables.
If you instead would like to manually create a `graphql` function with an explicit schema type,
[use `initGraphQLTada` instead.](#initgraphqltada)

#### Example

```ts
import { graphql } from 'gql.tada';
const bookFragment = graphql(`
  fragment BookComponent on Book {
    id
    title
  }
`);

const bookQuery = graphql(`
  query Book ($id: ID!) {
    book(id: $id) {
      id
      ...BookComponent
    }
  }
`, [bookFragment]);
```

### `graphql.scalar()`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `name` argument | A name of a GraphQL scalar or enum. |
| `value` argument | The value to be type-checked against the type. |
| returns | The `value` will be returned directly. | 

Type checks a given input value to be of a scalar or enum type and
returns the value directly.

You can use this utility to add a type check for a scalar or enum value,
or to retrieve the type of a scalar or enum.
This is useful if you’re writing a function or component that only accepts
a scalar or enum, but not a full fragment.

:::note
It’s not recommended to use this utiliy to replace fragments, i.e. to
create your own object types. Try to use fragments where appropriate
instead.
:::

#### Example

```ts {"Call graphql.scalar to type check a value against a scalar type:":4-5} {"Use ReturnType to get the type of a scalar directly:":8-9}
import { graphql } from 'gql.tada';

function validateMediaEnum(value: 'Book' | 'Song' | 'Video') {

  const media = graphql.scalar('Media', value);
}


type Media = ReturnType<typeof graphql.scalar<'Media'>>;
```

### `readFragment()`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `_document` argument | A GraphQL document of a fragment, created using [`graphql()`](#graphql). |
| `fragment` argument | A mask of the fragment, which can be wrapped in arrays, or nullable. |
| returns | The unmasked data of the fragment. | 

When [`graphql()`](#graphql) is used to create a fragment and is spread into another
fragment or query, their result types will only contain a “reference” to the
fragment. This encourages isolation and is known as “fragment masking.”

This means that you must use `readFragment()` to unmask these fragment masks
and get to the data. This encourages isolation and only using the data you define
a part of your codebase to require.

When passing `fragment` masks to `readFragment()`, you may also pass nullable, optional data, or data
wrapped in arrays to `readFragment()` and the result type will be unwrapped and inferred accordingly.

[Read more about fragment masking on the “Writing GraphQL” page.](../../get-started/writing-graphql/#fragment-masking)

#### Example

```ts
import { FragmentOf, graphql, readFragment } from 'gql.tada';

const bookFragment = graphql(`
  fragment BookComponent on Book {
    id
    title
  }
`);

const getBook = (data: FragmentOf<typeof bookFragment> | null) => {
  // Unmasks the fragment and casts to the result type of `bookFragment`
  // This is intersected with `| null` in this case, due to the input type.
  const book = readFragment(bookFragment, data);
};

const bookQuery = graphql(`
  query Book ($id: ID!) {
    book(id: $id) {
      id
      ...BookComponent
    }
  }
`, [bookFragment]);

const getQuery = (data: ResultOf<typeof bookQuery>) => {
  getBook(data?.book);
};
```

### `initGraphQLTada()`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Setup` generic | An [`AbstractSetupSchema` configuration object](#abstractsetupschema) |
| returns | A typed [`graphql()`](#graphql) function. | 

`initGraphQLTada` accepts an [`AbstractSetupSchema` configuration object](#abstractsetupschema) as a generic
and returns [a `graphql()` function](#graphql) that may be used to create documents typed using your
GraphQL schema.

You should use and re-export the resulting function named as `graphql` or `gql` for your
editor and the TypeScript language server to recognize your GraphQL documents correctly.

[Read more about how to use `initGraphQLTada()` on the “Installation” page.](../../get-started/installation/#initializing-gqltada-manually)

#### Example

```ts
import { initGraphQLTada } from 'gql.tada';
import type { introspection } from './graphql-env.d.ts';

export const graphql = initGraphQLTada<{
  introspection: introspection;
  scalars: {
    DateTime: string;
    Json: any;
  };
}>();

const query = graphql(`{ __typename }`);
```

## Types

### `ResultOf`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Document` generic | The document type of a `DocumentNode` carrying the result type. |

This accepts a [`TadaDocumentNode`](#tadadocumentnode) and returns the attached `Result` type
of GraphQL documents.

### `VariablesOf`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Document` generic | The document type of a `DocumentNode` carrying the variables type. |

This accepts a [`TadaDocumentNode`](#tadadocumentnode) and returns the attached `Variables` type
of GraphQL documents.

### `FragmentOf`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Document` generic | A `DocumentNode` containing a fragment definition. |

Creates a fragment mask for a given fragment document.

When [`graphql()`](#graphql) is used to create a fragment and is spread into another
fragment or query, their result types will only contain a “reference” to the
fragment. This encourages isolation and is known as “fragment masking.”

While [`readFragment()`](#readfragment) is used to unmask these fragment masks, this utility
creates a fragment mask, so you can accept the masked data in the part of your
codebase that defines a fragment.

[Read more about fragment masking on the “Writing GraphQL” page.](../../get-started/writing-graphql/#fragment-masking)

#### Example

```ts
import { FragmentOf, graphql, readFragment } from 'gql.tada';
const bookFragment = graphql(`
  fragment BookComponent on Book {
    id
    title
  }
`);

// May be called with any GraphQL data that contains a spread of `bookFragment`
const getBook = (data: FragmentOf<typeof bookFragment>) => {
  // Unmasks the fragment and casts to the result type of `bookFragment`
  const book = readFragment(bookFragment, data);
};
```

### `TadaDocumentNode`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Result` generic | The type of GraphQL results, as returned by GraphQL APIs for a given query. |
| `Variables` generic | The type of variables, as accepted by GraphQL APIs for a given query. |

A GraphQL `DocumentNode` with attached types for results and variables.

This is a GraphQL `DocumentNode` with attached types for results and variables.
This is used by GraphQL clients to infer the types of results and variables and provide
type-safety in GraphQL documents.

You can create typed GraphQL documents using the [`graphql()` function.](#graphql)

### `setupSchema`

You may extend this interface via declaration merging with your `IntrospectionQuery`
data and optionally your scalars to get proper type inference.
This is done by declaring a declaration for it as per the following example.

Configuring scalars is optional and by default the standard scalrs are already
defined.

This will configure the default `graphql()` export to infer types from your schema.
Alternatively, if you don’t want to define your schema project-wide,
you may call [`initGraphQLTada()`](#initgraphqltada) instead.

[Read more about setting up your schema on the “Installation” page.](../../get-started/installation/#step-3-configuring-typings)

#### Example

```ts
import type { introspection } from './graphql-env.d.ts';

declare module 'gql.tada' {
  interface setupSchema {
    introspection: introspection;
    scalars: {
      DateTime: string;
      Json: any;
    };
  }
}
```

### `AbstractSetupSchema`

| | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `introspection` property | Introspection of your schema in the `IntrospectionQuery` format. |
| `scalars` property | An optional object type with scalar names as keys and the corresponding scalar types as values. |

This is used either via [`setupSchema`](#setupschema) or [`initGraphQLTada()`](#initgraphqltada) to set
up your schema and scalars. Your configuration objects must match the shape of this type.

The `scalars` option is optional and can be used to set up more scalars, apart
from the default ones (like: Int, Float, String, Boolean).
It must be an object map of scalar names to their desired TypeScript types.
