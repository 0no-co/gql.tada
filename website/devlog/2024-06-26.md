# Future Setup Instructions <Badge text="2024/06/26" />

[TypeScript 5.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/)
was released recently which allows us to make an exciting
quality of life change to `gql.tada`!

Starting from v1.8.0, as long as you're using TypeScript 5.5,
you won't have to install `@0no-co/graphqlsp` yourself anymore,
and `gql.tada`'s setup comes down to just installing `gql.tada`
itself. We'll be updating our documentation in the future
to reflect this.

## The `gql.tada/ts-plugin` entry

The only dependency you'll now need to install directly is `gql.tada`,
so you can upgrade it and remove `@0no-co/graphqlsp`. The `gql.tada`
package will now install it as a sub-dependency.

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm uninstall --save-dev @0no-co/graphqlsp
npm install gql.tada@^1.8.0
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm remove @0no-co/graphqlsp
pnpm add gql.tada@^1.8.0
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn remove @0no-co/graphqlsp
yarn add gql.tada@^1.8.0
```

```sh [bun]
bun remove @0no-co/graphqlsp
bun add gql.tada@^1.8.0
```

::: details When you're installing from scratch
When you're setting up and installing `gql.tada` from
scratch, this means you'll only have to install a single
package.

::: code-group
```sh [npm]
npm install gql.tada
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add gql.tada
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add gql.tada
```

```sh [bun]
bun add gql.tada
```
:::

You can then update your `tsconfig.json` to use `"gql.tada/ts-plugin"`
instead of `@0no-co/graphqlsp`.

::: code-group
```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp", // [!code --]
        "name": "gql.tada/ts-plugin", // [!code ++]
        "schema": "./schema.graphql",
        "tadaOutputLocation": "./src/graphql-env.d.ts"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Why we made this change

In the previous state, TypeScript before its 5.5 update only allowed
full package specifiers to be used as plugins.
This, and other defaults, such as VSCode not using the workspace version
of TypeScript out of the box, causes situations that create friction when
someone first tries out `gql.tada`.

However, we want `gql.tada` to provide you a completely **frictionless** experience.

We kicked off a [small change request in TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/57266)
to allow sub-modules when specifying plugins, which now allows us to bundle `gql.tada/ts-plugin`
as the main entrypoint to our TypeScript plugin.

#### What this means for our documentation

We're aware that when we're explaining certain concepts about how `gql.tada` works, our mental
model of it can sometimes diverge wildly from how some of our users think about it.

As a recap, `gql.tada` consumes a typings file that contains a representation of your GraphQL
schema. This file is generated either by the `gql.tada` CLI or by the TypeScript plugin, when
you open a configured project.
The `gql.tada` library's types then allow it to parse and process GraphQL documents and use
the generated typings to derive GraphQL result and variables types for you.

The TypeScript plugin is often a misunderstood part of our pipeline. It's there to provide
the interactive GraphQL features to the TypeScript language server, such as auto-completion,
type hints, and diagnostics. But because it's a separate package, this distinction often
leads to convoluted explanations in our documentation.

Since the plugin is now installed via the `gql.tada/ts-plugin` entrypoint, we're deemphasizing
that it's separate and will update the documentation for clarity accordingly.

## `@defer` support

We'd like to take this opportunity to again point out that `gql.tada` already has support to
derive the correct types for `@defer`-ed fragments!

As long as your GraphQL API and client support `@defer`, it allows you to split up your GraphQL
query to receive several parts of its result later on. It's a quick way to specify which parts
of your query can be streamed in later on.

Thanks to members of [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/) testing this more extensively, we found
that in certain cases using `@defer` (or `@include` and `@skip`) on fragments with `gql.tada`
could cause type recursion errors.

In this latest version we patched this, and we want to encourage more people to test out
`@defer` and see if it benefits their applications.
