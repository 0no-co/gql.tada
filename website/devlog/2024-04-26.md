# Multi-Schema Mode <Badge text="2024/04/26" />

In our [previous minor devlog](./2024-04-15) we talked about
the CLI and our new Turbo Mode.
In v1.6.0 and our CLI releases up to it since then, we're
further polishing and working on the CLI, but we're
also here to introduce **Multi-Schema Support**!

## One more schema, please

When creating `gql.tada` we knew we'd eventually have to
work towards multi-schema support.

Increasingly in codebases, projects now consume a GraphQL
API on the back-end while also providing a GraphQL API to
the front-end. When you set up `gql.tada` in a monorepo
for your front-end apps with your own GraphQL API, that
used to be it - `gql.tada` could only support one schema
at a time and you were unable to consume more GraphQL APIs,
even if those were consumed on the back-end.

Today, we're releasing multi-schema support to solve this
problem. Instead of loading a single schema into `gql.tada`,
you can now load _multiple_!

### Configuring multiple schemas

We support multiple options to configure `gql.tada` and
`@0no-co/graphqlsp`. These configuration options are all
now considered to be per-schema options, namely:
- `schema`
- `tadaOutputLocation`
- `tadaTurboLocation`
- `tadaPersistedLocation`

Once you start adding a second GraphQL schema, you can move
these options onto a `schemas` array. You'll need to give each
schema its own `name` property however, so they can be identified
in the CLI and in your editor.

::: code-group
```json [tsconfig.json] {7-18}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp",
        "schemas": [
          {
            "name": "my-api",
            "schema": "./schema.graphql",
            "tadaOutputLocation": "./src/graphql-env.d.ts"
          },
          {
            "name": "my-api",
            "schema": "./cloudflare.graphql",
            "tadaOutputLocation": "./src/cloudflare-env.d.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
:::

Once you've set up multiple schemas, you need to set up `gql.tada`
manually by instantiating `initGraphQLTada()` to create a `graphql`
function for **each** schema separately.

    </p>
  </a>
  <a href="/reference/gql-tada-api#initgraphqltada" class="button">
    <h4>
      API Reference
   </h4>
    <p>
      Learn more about the <code>initGraphQLTada()</code> function
    </p>
  </a>
</div>

You will have to set up each schema separately; For our example above,
we'd set the following file up twice, once for `./src/graphql-env.d.ts`
and once for `./src/cloudflare-env.d.ts`.

```ts twoslash
import { initGraphQLTada } from 'gql.tada';
import type { introspection } from './graphql/graphql-env.d.ts';

export const graphql = initGraphQLTada<{
  introspection: introspection;
}>();

export type { FragmentOf, ResultOf, VariablesOf } from 'gql.tada';
export { readFragment } from 'gql.tada';
```

After setting up multiple `graphql` functions, each can then be
used for their corresponding schema. The CLI and GraphQLSP will
give you appropriate type hints and output for the corresponding
schema you've set up.

## Vue and Svelte

As of right now, we unfortunately can't support Vue and Svelte via
the default TypeScript language server, so GraphQLSP can't give you
hints, auto-completions, and its other features in `.vue` and `.svelte`
files.

However, looking over at the [Volar project](https://volarjs.dev/), we
realised that this doesn't mean we can't support `.vue` and `.svelte`
single-file components at all.

In [v1.2.0](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/releases/tag/%40gql.tada%2Fcli-utils%401.2.0)
of the CLI, we added experimental support for `.vue` and `.svelte`
support. This is exclusive to the CLI. While you'll miss out on
auto-completions and type-hints for GraphQL documents, you'll still
be able to use `gql.tada`'s typings and the `gql.tada` CLI to lint
your project.

Commands like `gql.tada check` will now detect `.vue` and `.svelte`
files, transpile them to TypeScript, and automatically provide
line-accurate diagnostics for them.
