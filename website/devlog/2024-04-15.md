# New CLI Workflows <Badge text="2024/04/15" />

#### the tl;dr

- The new `gql.tada` CLI supports new workflows
- Turbo Mode (via `gql.tada turbo`) speeds up TypeScript performance
- Persisted Operations are now supported

---

In the last few weeks we've been focusing on taking
large strides towards making `gql.tada` ready for
any production projects - existing or new ones alike.

To recap where we were before this new release,
- [GraphQLSP](https://github.com/0no-co/graphqlsp) is responsible for
  providing diagnostics and auto-completions in your editor via the
  TypeScript language server plugin API,
- The main `gql.tada` library contains typings to infer
  the types of your GraphQL documents.

While, GraphQLSP can provide interactive hints in
your editor however, it can't intervene in when things
go wrong. Specifically, outside of type checks, `gql.tada`
leaned on the in-editor plugin telling you when something
went wrong.

It also [generates the `graphql-env.d.ts`](/get-started/installation#step-3-—-configuring-typings), the typings output file that `gql.tada` needs
to perform its type inferences.

However, to go further, with more diagnostics and type
generation that work in large teams and support more
advanced workflows with `gql.tada`, **we need a CLI.**

## Hi, `gql.tada` CLI!

Recent efforts have been to work on [RFC #76](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/issues/76).
We focused on a CLI that can support use-cases where the LSP plugin isn't an option
or where more outputs and diagnostics are needed, as such, our CLI supports several
commands now, starting with version `v1.5.0`.

| Command | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `doctor` | Automatic checks to ensure `gql.tada` is set up and installed correctly. |
| `check` | Runs all diagnostics that GraphQLSP runs in the CLI. |
| `generate output` | Generates the `gql.tada` output file for type checking, like GraphQLSP does. |
| `generate schema` | Used to introspect a GraphQL API or schema. |
| `generate persisted` | Used to extract a JSON manifest of persisted documents. |
| `generate turbo` | Used to generate a typings cache to speed up TypeScript performance. |

We consider the addition of the CLI with these commands to be
the minimum required to enable all major client-side workflows
the GraphQL community needs to migrate to `gql.tada`.

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI is currently in **beta**, but we consider it ready
> to be used as of now.
>
> Please report any issues or shortcomings you encounter in
> our issues.

### Supplementing GraphQLSP workflows

The `gql.tada check` command outputs diagnostics that the LSP usually outputs inline
in the editor.

```sh
gql.tada check
```

We need the `check` command because GraphQLSP has GraphQL-relevant diagnostics that
will not be output when we run `tsc`. Specifically, the `check` command performs
validation on all your GraphQL documents in `gql.tada`.

Similarly, the `gql.tada generate output` command replicates how GraphQLSP outputs
the introspection file for `gql.tada`'s typings to function.

```sh
gql.tada generate output
```

Both of these commands stand in for GraphQLSP during continuous integration or
during pre-commit checks.

You can read more about these commands on our new reference docs page:
- [`gql.tada check` command](/reference/gql-tada-cli#check)
- [`gql.tada generate output` command](/reference/gql-tada-cli#generate-output)

### GitHub Actions support

The `check` command, and other commands that output diagnostics; namely, `generate persisted`
and `generate turbo`, have output support for GitHub Actions.

[GitHub's Actions workflows allow for custom commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-a-notice-message)
that can be used to annotate pull requests with rich diagnostics diagnostics output in their UI.
The CLI supports this so you don't have to read and parse the CLI output manually
on GitHub Actions.

### Introspection Schemas

To close another gap in the workflows we support, the CLI also supports a `generate schema`
command. This command is used to introspect a GraphQL API and output a `.graphql` SDL file.

::: code-group
```sh [npm]
npm gql.tada generate schema 'https://api.github.com/graphql'
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm gql.tada generate schema 'https://api.github.com/graphql'
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn gql.tada generate schema 'https://api.github.com/graphql'
```

```sh [bun]
bun run gql.tada generate schema 'https://api.github.com/graphql'
```
:::

By default, this command looks at your `schema` configuration and
writes to its file path.
This is because this command is useful when your GraphQL API is
not directly accessible via GraphQLSP, for instance, because you
need to add authorization headers to all requests. (Hint: the CLI
accepts `--header` options)

You can also write any schema you're introspecting to a different
file path, by passing the `--output` option, or by piping the command
to an output file (i.e. `gql.tada generate schema [url] > output.graphql`)
The CLI also accepts a different `.graphql` SDL file as an input,
and shares the same introspection logic across GraphQLSP and other
CLI commands.

We've seen many requests to support more use-cases where the API
is not run locally, is in a separate repository, or simply needs
headers sourced from environment variables. This new command is
our answer to this request.

## Persisted Operations Support

Persisted Operations are on their way to
[be standardized in GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/PersistedOperations.md)
and are an important tool in securing GraphQL APIs and
offering a tool to turn GraphQL API communication into
an RPC-like transport.

---

At the most basic level, there are two approaches to
persisted operations. "Automatic Persisted Queries" (APQ) already
worked with `gql.tada` prior to this release as it's a
client-side protocol.

With APQ, queries are hashed and generate an ID during runtime.
This means that the client:
- generates a docuemnt ID (by convention, most of the time a SHA256 hash of the document)
- it attempts to send this ID instead of the GraphQL document
- if the API doesn't recognize the document, it can optionally attempt to send
  both the ID and the document, and the API can choose to start recognizing it
  as an alias.

You can learn more about this on the documentation of several
GraphQL clients, for example [the `urql` page on persisted
queries](https://urql.dev/goto/docs/advanced/persistence-and-uploads/#automatic-persisted-queries).

---

**Persisted Operations** go beyond this approach and remove the
dynamic generation of document IDs.

With **persisted operations** the goal is to discover all GraphQL operations
that a GraphQL client can send during build-time. This allows you to build
up an allowlist of known GraphQL documents ahead of time.

We've added a new API to `gql.tada` to facilitate this, `graphql.persisted()`.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: graphq-env.d.ts
export type introspection = {
  __schema: {
    queryType: {
      name: 'Query';
    };
    mutationType: null;
    subscriptionType: null;
    types: [
      {
        kind: 'OBJECT';
        name: 'Query';
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'hello';
            type: {
              kind: 'SCALAR';
              name: 'String';
              ofType: null;
            };
            args: [];
          },
          {
            name: 'world';
            type: {
              kind: 'SCALAR';
              name: 'String';
              ofType: null;
            };
            args: [];
          },
        ];
        interfaces: [];
      },
      {
        kind: 'SCALAR';
        name: 'String';
      },
    ];
    directives: [];
  };
};

import * as gqlTada from 'gql.tada';

declare module 'gql.tada' {
  interface setupSchema {
    introspection: introspection;
  }
}

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut-before---
import { graphql } from 'gql.tada';

const HelloQuery = graphql(`
  query Hello {
    hello
  }
`);

const HelloQueryPersisted = graphql.persisted('sha256:x', HelloQuery);
```

In the above example, the `graphql.persisted()` call creates a new
`DocumentNode` that carries the document ID (passed as a first argument)
on a `documentId` property.

If you're not using a normalized cache (such as Apollo Client's or urql Graphcache)
you can then even compile away the original document and just only send the
document ID, since you have a manifest of all queries the client can send.
We can achieve this by passing the query by type instead:

```ts twoslash
// @filename: graphq-env.d.ts
export type introspection = {
  __schema: {
    queryType: {
      name: 'Query';
    };
    mutationType: null;
    subscriptionType: null;
    types: [
      {
        kind: 'OBJECT';
        name: 'Query';
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'hello';
            type: {
              kind: 'SCALAR';
              name: 'String';
              ofType: null;
            };
            args: [];
          },
          {
            name: 'world';
            type: {
              kind: 'SCALAR';
              name: 'String';
              ofType: null;
            };
            args: [];
          },
        ];
        interfaces: [];
      },
      {
        kind: 'SCALAR';
        name: 'String';
      },
    ];
    directives: [];
  };
};

import * as gqlTada from 'gql.tada';

declare module 'gql.tada' {
  interface setupSchema {
    introspection: introspection;
  }
}

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut-before---
import { graphql } from 'gql.tada';

const HelloQuery = graphql(`
  query Hello {
    hello
  }
`);

const HelloQueryPersisted = graphql.persisted<typeof HelloQuery>('sha256:x');
```

In our above example, provided `HelloQuery` (and potential fragments your queries
may be referencing) are never used by value and only by type, your documents
will be tree-shaken and minified out of your output bundle.

### Persisted Manifests

The `gql.tada generate persisted` command scans our codebase for `graphql.persisted()`
calls and extracts your persisted documents into a JSON manifest.

```sh
gql.tada generate persisted -o persisted.json
```

The JSON manifest contains the document IDs as keys mapped to the document string values,
which we can then go on to register with our APIs ahead of deployment.

### GraphQLSP Support

GraphQLSP has also been [updated](https://github.com/0no-co/GraphQLSP/pull/287)
to support **Persisted Operations**.

It now provides hints when you're using `graphql.persisted()` to validate its usage,
and also features a code action that allows you to quickly update the document ID
to a new hash whenever the query changes.

You can find the full API docs for Persisted Operations in our reference docs:
- [the `graphql.persisted()` API](/reference/gql-tada-api#graphql-persisted)
- [the `gql.tada generate persisted` command](/reference/gql-tada-cli#generate-persisted)

## Turbo Mode 🔥

We've been working hard on making type inference in `gql.tada` as fast as it can be.
If you'd like to be up-to-date on what we've done to address TypeScript performance
to be better, we now have [a GitHub milestone](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/milestone/1?closed=1)
that tracks all performance-related issues and fixes.

We realise that there is a limit to how fast parsing GraphQL in the
TypeScript type system can be, but while this is a common assumption,
we love to challenge this by finding optimizations in our TypeScript types.

However, even with continuous optimizations and this having been our focus
for several weeks, even if `gql.tada`'s type inference got 10x faster, this
can always be negated by a code base having 10x more documents.

This mostly doesn't show itself in editing performance, unless a document
has a lot of fragment references, but running `tsc` and performing type
checks on a full codebase always incurs the cost of inferring the types
of all your documents.

### Codegen and Inference

If we were to only generate types ahead of time, we would:
- lose the benefits of expressing GraphQL in the TypeScript type system
- have decreased editing performance (ironically) and don't get editing feedback in real-time
- have extra steps that are always required to see GraphQL types in TypeScript

However, with `gql.tada`, as previously established we get type
inference as fast as TypeScript can infer them - all while we edit
with no extra commands running in the background and no reevaluation
of generated files.

**We really do want to have our cake and eat it too,** which is why
we're introducing a "Turbo Mode" enabled by our CLI.

::: code-group
```sh [npm]
npm gql.tada turbo
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm gql.tada turbo
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn gql.tada turbo
```

```sh [bun]
bun run gql.tada turbo
```
:::

The `gql.tada turbo` command creates a code-generated typings file
of the GraphQL documents in your codebase, which is fed into `gql.tada`
as a cache, of sorts.

After running the command, the types of `graphql()` documents are first
looked up from the cache that have been cached and generated into the
turbo typings file, essentially skipping type inference.
If we then start editing our documents, type inference kicks in and
infers the type of a document dynamically.

This combines the best of both worlds; GraphQL type generation and
GraphQL type inference and is a new middleground to ensure best
performance and the dynamic benefits of type inference.

### Adapting to Turbo Workflows

To gain the benefits of `gql.tada turbo`, you could for example,
run it before submitting your pull request, or before committing
changes, or as a pre-commit hook.

As `gql.tada turbo` is always optional, you can run it ahead of time
or after you're done editing your documents.

GraphQLSP never generates this file, so you don't have to wait
for codegen to complete while editing.

> [!NOTE]
> We can guarantee that the types between **Turbo Mode** and
> `gql.tada`'s default type inference are consistent because
> the turbo typings are just a cache.

The `turbo` command uses TypeScript's type output, so make sure
that you've got an up-to-date `gql.tada` output file present,
which you can of course generate using `gql.tada generate output`
before running the `turbo` command.

## What's next?

We'd like to focus on multi-schema support next.

With just one GraphQLSP and `gql.tada` configuration, we should be
able to support multiple schemas at the same time,
enabling you to use `gql.tada` for third-party schemas,
while still consuming your own GraphQL API.

We don't have an RFC for this yet, but you can read some
[discussions and notes](https://github.com/0no-co/GraphQLSP/discussions/223#discussioncomment-9050883)
about this in the meantime.
