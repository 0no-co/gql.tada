# Development

Thanks for contributing! We want to ensure that `gql.tada` evolves to become
the best experience to write and use GraphQL with TypeScript on the client-side,
by seeing continuous improvements and enhancements, no matter how small or big they might be.

## How to contribute?

We follow fairly standard but lenient rules around pull requests and issues.
Please pick a title that describes your change briefly, optionally in the imperative
mood if possible.

If you have an idea for a feature or want to fix a bug, consider opening an issue
first. We're also happy to discuss and help you open a PR and get your changes
in!

- If you have a question, try [creating a GitHub Discussions thread.](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/discussions/new)
- If you think you've found a bug, [open a new issue.](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/issues/new/choose)
- or, if you found a bug you'd like to fix, [open a PR.](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/compare)
- If you'd like to propose a change [open an RFC issue.](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/issues/new?labels=future+%F0%9F%94%AE&template=RFC.md&title=RFC%3A+Your+Proposal) You can read more about the RFC process [below](#how-do-i-propose-changes).

### What are the issue conventions?

There are **no strict conventions**, but we do have two templates in place that will fit most
issues, since questions and other discussion start on GitHub Discussions. The bug template is fairly
standard and the rule of thumb is to try to explain **what you expected** and **what you got
instead.** Following this makes it very clear whether it's a known behavior, an unexpected issue,
or an undocumented quirk.

We do ask that issues _aren’t_ created for questions, or where a bug is likely to be either caused
by misusage or misconfiguration. In short, if you can’t provide a reproduction of the issue, then
it may be the case that you’ve got a question instead.

### How do I propose changes?

We follow an **RFC proposal process**. This allows anyone to propose a new feature or a change, and
allows us to communicate our current planned features or changes, so any technical discussion,
progress, or upcoming changes are always **documented transparently.** You can [find the RFC
template](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/issues/new/choose) in our issue creator.

### What are the PR conventions?

This also comes with **no strict conventions**. We only ask you to follow the PR template we have
in place more strictly here than the templates for issues, since it asks you to list a summary
(maybe even with a short explanation) and a list of technical changes.

If you're **resolving** an issue please don't forget to add `Resolve #123` to the description so that
it's automatically linked, so that there's no ambiguity and which issue is being addressed (if any)

You'll find that a comment by the "Changeset" bot may pop up. If you don't know what a **changeset**
is and why it's asking you to document your changes, read on at ["How do I document a change for the
changelog"](#how-do-i-document-a-change-for-the-changelog)

## How do I set up the project?

Luckily it's not hard to get started. You can install dependencies
[using `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack).
Please don't use `npm` or `yarn` to respect the lockfile.

```sh
pnpm install
```

There are multiple commands you can run in the root folder to test your changes:

```sh
# TypeScript checks:
pnpm run check

# Linting (prettier & eslint):
pnpm run lint

# Unit Tests (for all packages):
pnpm run test

# Builds (for all packages):
pnpm run build
```

## How do I test my changes?

It's always good practice to run the tests when making changes. If you're unsure which packages
may be affected by your new tests or changes you may run `pnpm test` in the root of
the repository.

If your editor is not set up with type checks you may also want to run `pnpm run check` on your
changes.

Additionally you can head to any example in the `examples/` folder
and run them.

## How do I lint my code?

We ensure consistency in `gql.tada`'s codebase using `eslint` and `prettier`.
They are run on a `precommit` hook, so if something's off they'll try
to automatically fix up your code, or display an error.

If you have them set up in your editor, even better!

## How do I document a change for the changelog?

This project uses [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets). This means that for
every PR there must be documentation for what has been changed and which package is affected.

You can document a change by running `changeset`, which will ask you which packages
have changed and whether the change is major/minor/patch. It will then ask you to write
a change entry as markdown.

```sh
# In the root of the urql repository call:
pnpm changeset
```

This will create a new "changeset file" in the `.changeset` folder, which you should commit and
push, so that it's added to your PR.
This will eventually end up in the package's `CHANGELOG.md` file when we do a release.

You won't need to add a changeset if you're simply making "non-visible" changes to the docs or other
files that aren't published to the npm registry.

[Read more about adding a `changeset` here.](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md#i-am-in-a-multi-package-repository-a-mono-repo)

## How do I release new versions of our packages?

Hold up, that's **automated**! Since we use `changeset` to document our changes, which determines what
goes into the changelog and what kind of version bump a change should make, you can also use the
tool to check what's currently posed to change after a release batch using: `pnpm changeset status`.

We have a [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflow/release.yml) which is triggered whenever new
changes are merged. It will always open a **"Version Packages" PR** which is kept up-to-date. This PR
documents all changes that are made and will show in its description what all new changelogs are
going to contain for their new entries.

Once a "Version Packages" PR is approved by a contributor and merged, the action will automatically
take care of creating the release, publishing all updated packages to the npm registry, and creating
appropriate tags on GitHub too.

This process is automated, but the changelog should be checked for errors.

As to **when** to merge the automated PR and publish? Maybe not after every change. Typically there
are two release batches: hotfixes and release batches. We expect that a hotfix for a single package
should go out as quickly as possible if it negatively affects users. For **release batches**
however, it's common to assume that if one change is made to a package that more will follow in the
same week. So waiting for **a day or two** when other changes are expected will make sense to keep the
fatigue as low as possible for downstream maintainers.
