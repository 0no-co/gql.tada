# gql.tada

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix `readFragment()` not inferring the types of complex fragments, i.e. fragments that derive with a union type
  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#15](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/pull/15))
- Make `$tada.fragmentRefs` property required. Previously, this was optional (to mirror what GCG’s client-preset does). However, this can lead to invalid checks in `readFragment`, as it would be able to match types that don’t actually match the fragment refs

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix `__typename` literal string not being exact and instead a union of possible types, when the `__typename` field is put onto an abstract type’s selection set

## 1.0.0

**Initial Release**

`gql.tada` is a GraphQL document authoring library, inferring the result and variables types
of GraphQL queries and fragments in the TypeScript type system. It derives the types for your
GraphQL queries on the fly allowing you to write type-safe GraphQL documents quickly.
