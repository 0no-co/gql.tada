/** Annotations for GraphQLâ€™s `DocumentNode` with attached generics for its result data and variables types.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A GraphQL {@link DocumentNode} defines both the variables it accepts on request and the `data`
 * shape it delivers on a response in the GraphQL query language.
 *
 * To bridge the gap to TypeScript, tools may be used to generate TypeScript types that define the shape
 * of `data` and `variables` ahead of time. These types are then attached to GraphQL documents using this
 * `TypedDocumentNode` type.
 *
 * Using a `DocumentNode` that is typed like this will cause any `urql` API to type its input `variables`
 * and resulting `data` using the types provided.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * For compatibility reasons this type has been copied and internalized from:
 * https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node/blob/3711b12/packages/core/src/index.ts#L3-L10
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node} for more information.
