/** Private namespace holding our symbols for markers.

 * @remarks
 * Markers are used to indicate, for example, which fragments a given GraphQL document
 * is referring to or which fragments a document exposes. This ties into “fragment masking”,
 * a process by which the type of a fragment is hidden away until it’s unwrapped, to enforce
 * isolation and code-reuse.
