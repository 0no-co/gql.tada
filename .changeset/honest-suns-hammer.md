Add multi-schema support to the CLI (See [RFC](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada/issues/248) for more details.) With multi-schema support, the configuration now accepts `schemas` as an option to set up multiple schemas that can be instantiated with `initGraphQLTada()` in parallel in the same codebase.
